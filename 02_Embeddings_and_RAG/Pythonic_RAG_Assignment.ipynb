A nice snack break', \"Location: Suches resupply\\nDescription: Resupply for 1 day. A dirty gas station with what you'd expect in a small town.

We aren't looking forward to eating this day of food.\", 'Location: Hitchhiking from/to here\\nDescription: Hitchhiked to Suches and back\\xa0 The first car we saw picked us up in both directions.

Getting back off the hard ground is tough when you're this sore.\", \"Location: Jarrard Gap Tentsite\\nDescription: Night 4. Nice dispersed camping. A spot notorious for bears. The tree being used by many seemed a little sus to us so we ended up walking almost 5 minutes from camp before we found a proper tree to hang our food from. Some fellow hikers were out of cigarettes but weren't planning on going to town, so we offered to bring them a pack. They almost cried when they showed up and saw us. We stayed up late tonight...almost 9pm. Ramen and hot dogs for dinner.\", 'Location: Viewpoint Blood Mountain\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Neels Gap\\nDescription: We hitchhiked from here to Blairsville to resupply. Took awhile to get picked up. Turtle Pops, a kind of grungy old man, was hitching with us so I get the feeling he might have effected the wait time. He's a nice guy though. This is also where the infamous Mountain Crossings outfitter is, where Just Bill helped us fit our packs properly. There is a tree with lots of shoes hanging from hikers who either quit their journey here or got new shoes at the store.\", 'Location: Blairsville resupply\\nDescription: Resupply for 4 days.

We packed out fresh mushrooms and spinach, they were delicious. Then we tried to hang our food and the cord snapped and all 20ish pounds of food landed less than a foot from being on top of Brandi's head. It's our first major gear failure and it's happened twice. A thunderstorm is hitting tonight...we'll see how it goes. Olivier's knees still hurt, but we got some different supports and some KT tape to try.

We'll take it slow the next few days, and maybe have our first night in a hostel on Monday.\", \"Location: Lunch\\nDescription: Nothing positive. Olivier's knees are hurting a lot.\", \"Location: Blue Mountain Shelter\\nDescription: Night 7&8. We decided to take a zero day (a day we don't hike) here to address Olivier's knees more carefully. They have been painful on and off (but mostly on) since day 2. We think Olivier has Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS). A band of connective tissue that stretches along the outside of the legs gets tense and inflamed due to overuse and tight muscles, causing it to rub against tendons and bones of the knee. At its worst, it feels like a stab to the side of the knee with every step. Luckily for us, it seems there's a few stretching exercises that can help prevent it. We're trying that now. -- We also had our second rainy night. Once again, it's small potatoes compared to weathering a storm on the boat.\", \"Location: Hitchhiking & Lunch\\nDescription: After a zero day full of butt massaging (it was not as pleasant as it sounds...Olivier was all but crying) and stretching, we dipped our toes in the water with a 2.4 mile climb down to Unicoi Gap. Olivier's knees did surprisingly well. We had our thumbs out to hitchhike and a shuttle driver picked us up free of charge since he was going that way anyways. We also had Buttercup with us...a very interesting hiker with what I assume to be a 70 pound pack who's been offering his services of 'lightening your load' by taking extra food from hikers. He stunk really badly.\", 'Location: Hiawassee resupply\\nDescription: We got dropped off right at the grocery store, an Ingles, and resupplied for four days. We also each got a salad from the salad bar for lunch and a foot long sub from the deli to take for our dinner at camp that night. I had a bunch of watermelon and of course Olivier had a banana.', \"Location: Primitive Camping\\nDescription: Night 9. After hitchhiking back (and the guy blowing past our stop so we had to hike back up the highway, our bad for assuming there was only one place with Unicoi in the name) we went less than a mile to some campsites close to a water source. It's our first night alone since night zero at Amicalola Falls State Park. Our plan is to average 4 miles over the next four days. A very slow pace to allow Olivier's knees to keep healing and our new stretching practices to take effect. Hopefully after that we will resume 8-10 mile days and eventually 10-15. Also the subs were too big and I was right that we could've shared one.\", \"Location: Tray Mountain Shelter\\nDescription: Night 10. It rained a lot overnight and was our first morning packing up and hiking in substantial rain. Our packs were much heavier than normal with everything being wet, and we were highly motivated to get to the next shelter to be able to dry things off. We didn't take a single picture today, in fact the phone stayed in a Ziploc bag all day. We did see some salamanders, I was very excited about that. Olivier's knees were good today. When there was some pain we stopped to stretch and were back to normal. It rained all 5 miles to the shelter, and then when it stopped raining it promptly got very windy and cold. Tonight the temperature should drop to freezing with high winds all night. But tomorrow, sunshine!\", \"Location: John's Spring Campsite\\nDescription: Night 11. Overnight we were thankfully warm enough. The wind was gusting 30 knots all night but we managed to both sleep well. This morning was literally freezing. Our socks were frozen solid...we put them in a Ziploc against our bodies to thaw enough to put on. Olivier managed to keep his shoes mostly dry through all of the rain yesterday but my shoes were frozen. I had to get back into my sleeping bag after breakfast because I was afraid of a toe getting frostbitten from the wet shoes and freezing temps. Olivier brought me hot coffee and put my shoes in the sun to dry. Finally we got going and did a short 5 mile day. The knees were mostly okay. The water source at this camp is beautiful. A spring coming up out of the earth right under a big tree.\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Deep Gap Shelter\\nDescription: Night 12. We had a really short day today with beautiful weather. Since our pace is slow right now everyone we meet at the shelters are new to us. Today was a very comical group with lots of laughs. Towards the end of the night we were chatting with a section hiker who has the same knee problem as Olivier. He gave us some new exercises that we hadn't seen before that seem really hopeful. We go stay at a hostel tomorrow for the first time. Meaning yes, we've gone almost 2 weeks without a shower. Aside from our resupply tomorrow, our big goal is to find an exercise band for Olivier to strengthen his hips which should eliminate the problem with his IT bands. Still hopeful! -- The photo is of the water source at the shelter. Most shelters have one nearby and this one was particularly beautiful.\", \"Location: Dick's Creek Gap\\nDescription: Left the trail here and hiked 0.5 miles along the road to Around The Bend Hostel.\", \"Location: Hostel Around the Bend\\nDescription: Night 13. Staying at this hostel tonight. Showers, a bed, a ride to town and loaner clothes--exactly what the hikers need. We also got a chance to weigh ourselves for the first time since we got started. I've gained two pounds and Olivier has gained four. We've been trying our best to consume 3500-4000 calories per day and it seems it's been enough to put on weight. -- We went to Hiawassee again to resupply.\", 'Location: Plum Orchard Shelter\\nDescription: April 22, night 14. We took a shuttle from the hostel to the trail head and walked 5 miles to the closest shelter. My knees were great during most of the hike, but started to hurt right before the end. I\\'m not fully healed, but making progress at least. We had great home cooked dinner and breakfast at the hostel, which we shared with another thru-hiker that goes by GG\" aka \"Geisha Girl\". Most of the trees have been devoid of leaves since we started the thru-hiker', \"Location: Georgia/North Carolina Border\\nDescription: April 23. We made it out of Georgia! We did it a bit slower than most, but we're still going, and that's what's important.\", \"Location: Lunch\\nDescription: I (Brandi) was feeling a bit dizzy and fatigued today so a big lunch was needed. We still aren't tired of the roasted garlic Naan. We think Asiago cheese has better flavor than the Romano we tried this time.\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Muskrat Creek Shelter\\nDescription: April 23. Night 15. We hiked 7.3 miles today which was a big milestone. We haven't done more than 5 since Olivier's knees became really painful.

Flowers, a tadpole pond, and uninterrupted views.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: April 25.', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: The salami was so delicious that I almost fell asleep on a rock after eating it. Listening to the water was really nice. -B', 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Break\\nDescription: Carter Gap Shelter. After several signs warning of high bear activity, we decided to go a few miles further than planned. The terrain was gradual today and we felt good.', \"Location: Betty's Creek Campsite\\nDescription: April 25. Night 17. We hiked a whopping 11.3 miles today. It's our longest day on the trail so far. At our afternoon break we met another advocate for kinesiology tape, so we threw a few strips on Olivier and apparently it worked pretty well. He felt great for the last 3.7 miles to camp. Until he was doing his strengthening exercises and did something weird to cause a big cramp/spasm in his leg and now his knee feels bad again. What a weirdo. This is why we can't have nice things. Anyways, we saw our second snake today, a bunny, and it took us 30 minutes to hang our bear line. Someone also left an apple on a sign at our campsite which was absolutely delicious. Very entertaining day. -B\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', 'Location: 100 miles mark\\nDescription: We reached the 100 mile mark of the AT at the summit of Albert Mountain after a steep climb. The view is great from up there, but clouds stated to surround us as we were arriving. It started to rain just as we were starting to hike down 10 minutes later. Rain gear out, it was a nice descent with a small gradient, and Brandi made up a song about being in the rain on the AT. -O', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped for lunch at Long Branch Shelter and there we met Dinosaur, a 74 year old thru-hiker. As we were chatting, he gave us some interesting news about the night before at Carter Gap Shelter. Out of 6 food bags that were hung, 4 were taken by bears! Brandi was right yesterday to skip Carter Gap Shelter and push on to Betty Creek. -O', \"Location: Rock Gap Shelter\\nDescription: April 26. Night 18. Dinosaur also warned us about the rowdy crowd with whom he had shared the shelter at Carter Gap. They are here tonight and they are rowdy, to say the least! It's a frat party. There is also a man that drove from town and brought fruit and drinks to share. -O\", 'Location: Hitchhiking point\\nDescription: April 27. Woke up at 5:30 to hike 3.8 miles to Winding Stair Gap in time to take a shuttle to Franklin, NC to resupply.', \"Location: Walmart Resupply\\nDescription: April 27. Resupplied for 4.5 days, starting April 28. We had lunch in the parking lot. We got a pack of croissants and Brandi cooked breakfast sausages in front of amused passerbys. Franklin is very hiker-friendly, they are considered an 'Appalachian Trail Community.' While in Walmart one lady walked up, handed us $20, said 'Happy hiking,' and walked away before we could even respond. Another person brought a bag of candy bars to all of the hikers sitting out front! Many many others stopped to chat. It was lovely.\", \"Location: Siler Bald Shelter\\nDescription: April 27. Night 19. Would you believe, with packs full of heavy food, and the way Olivier's knees have been feeling, that we got to our planned campsite and decided to go an extra 3 miles??? Me neither. We're feeling really good. When it's cold or steep, Olivier is still having pain, but otherwise it's time to start moving on up! We ate Jimmy Dean breakfast burritos for dinner that we thawed in the sun at Walmart, then warmed up in our pockets at camp for that perfect 98 degree eating temperature. Add some fresh spinach and an avocado, it was divine. I also washed a gross Ziploc bag in the Walmart bathroom today so I think I'm officially hiker trash. -B\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: April 28. Hiked a side trail up Siler Bald after leaving camp this morning. There was a group of 4 recently retired guys that were a hoot to chat with.', \"Location: Tower\\nDescription: A very cool lookout tower where we could see a few of the mountains we came from. In particular, we could see the fire tower we were at a couple of days ago on top of Albert Mountain. It was a bit of a tourist stop too, so there were trash cans to offload our banana peels and other garbage we'd accumulated since town. The clear skies were a nice change from the rain we had at the last tower.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We ate so much food that we went another 5 miles after lunch. Salami, avocado, Asiago cheese, and pita bread. We even had salt and pepper packets from a Subway for the avo. Not everyone on the trail is surviving on peanut butter tortillas.', \"Location: Cold Spring Shelter\\nDescription: April 28. Night 20. We were worried about arriving late and not being able to find a flat spot to pitch the tent, but when we walked up at 5pm we were the first here out of what would turn out to be only 4 people. The shelter here is a very old original shelter, which was cool. Our bear line snapped (again, but a different line) while trying to hang our food, which was not cool. Fortunately, we've learned very quickly to never stand underneath the food you're hoisting or the branch you're using to hang it on. That 2+ pound bear can looks more appealing every day.\", \"Location: Fire Tower\\nDescription: Wesser Bald fire tower. The best view we've had so far. We chatted with some nice ladies on a vacation who were very curious about thru-hiking. They had a lot of questions including how long it'd been since we'd showered. We told them to stay upwind of us just to be safe ha.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: Wesser Bald Shelter. I went to lay out the groundsheet for the tent and Olivier said he felt good and we should keep going, so we had a quick lunch and headed off.', 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Rufus Morgan Shelter\\nDescription: April 29. Night 21. What a kick in the nuts of a morning. After feeling mostly great yesterday, Olivier's knees started hurting A LOT within the first 30 minutes of hiking. Around 11am we were feeling totally defeated and decided to just lay down in the shade for awhile. After a nap I felt motivated, so I did some more searching of the internet about ITBS, especially in long distance hikers, and found a new routine to try. Olivier was grumpy, but I basically insisted and by the end he was feeling much better. Enough so that we did 7 more miles! Did the routine of exercises and massages again at camp, and plan to keep it up twice a day. We're hopeful. Another day of highs and lows.\", \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: April 30. We skipped our usual breakfast at camp and instead hiked 1 mile to the town of Wesser and got breakfast at the diner there. The trail goes right through this small town. There's a general store, a restaurant and an outfitter--not much more.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped for lunch at a viewpoint called The Jump Up. We had a variation of our typical lunch: pulled pork, cheese and a bagel. This time we also has a garlic spread that turned out to just taste like mayo. We also has two avocadoes, but we only ate one because the other one rolled down the mountain. Whoops.', 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: Cheoah Bald. The climb up this mountain was tough.', \"Location: Locust Cove Campsite\\nDescription: April 30. Night 22. We did another long day, especially considering we stopped for breakfast at the restaurant in NOC. 11.5 miles! Unlike yesterday, today was mostly pain free in the knee department. From yesterday morning at Cold Spring Shelter to now, we've ascended over 6500 feet and descended over 5000 feet. I think we've earned a nearo (near zero mile day) so we booked a hostel for tomorrow night that will pick us up just over 3 miles from here. Resting will be good, and a shower couldn't hurt either. -B -- We had an eventful night here. After sunset, when everybody was already in their tents and some people snoring, we could hear a large animal walk very close to camp. It came right alongside our tent and then ran away downhill. The noises persisted and we were convinced it was a bear trying to get a food bag that had been hung in that area. Brandi got out of the tent to investigate and realized that it wasn't a bear, it was two boars. There's no chance of them taking the food bag, but actually they are more dangerous than a black bear, so Brandi returned to the tent. Later in the night, I was woken up to other hikers yelling at a bear that was making noise up on a hill next to camp. Once again, we got out of the tent to investigate. With Brandi's super powerful headlamp, we could see that it wasn't a bear, it was a dear. -O\", 'Location: Trail Magic and Hitchhiking\\nDescription: May 1. Stecoah Gap. This was our planned spot to hitchhike into Robbinsville to resupply. When we arrived, we were very happy to see that there was trail magic. Two couples that were travelling in a camper had hotdogs, chips, drinks and other snacks. It was great. Then, the rain that was in the forecast materialized. It was a strong, but short-lasting downpour. After the rain had stopped, we went over to the road to hitchhike into town. After only 5 minutes, one of the trail angels came over to give us a ride into town.', 'Location: Robbinsville resupply\\nDescription: Resupplied for 5.5 days, starting May 2nd.

Before leaving the hostel we had a huge breakfast. 3 eggs each, half a package of bacon, and three big slices of toast. After getting dropped off at the trailhead at 9am we had a brutal climb, but the rest of the day was more mellow. We walked up on a wild turkey doing a big colorful display for a female before getting spooked by us and flying away through the trees along with his potential mate. We could hear their wings slapping the leaves and branches on the way out. We seem do be doing well with our new pace of 10-12 miles. The exercise routine is a pain to do twice a day, but it seems to be working!', \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: We skipped our usual breakfast at camp and instead just had a snack and left early to have breakfast at a bistro in Fontana. We were planning to hitchhike or catch a shuttle into town from here, but the road had no traffic and the shuttle entailed a 1 hour wait. So we decided to cook our usual breakfast grits instead of going into town. We had done our last resupply assuming we would get meal from town, so our change of plans meant we were short of 1 meal. So we walked to the Fontana Marina to get today's lunch. The options were limited to hiker food, so we got tortillas and tuna packets. It's what most people are eating regularly out here. -O\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped at a water source to eat the lunch items we got from Fontana Marina earlier today.', 'Location: Fire tower\\nDescription: This fire tower was very tall! We climbed to the top to take pictures of the view and promptly came back down, because it was scary. -O', \"Location: Birch Spring Campsite\\nDescription: May 3. Night 25. We had a satisfying 11+ mile day again. The people we were leapfrogging all day were going to a shelter that's 4 miles after this campsite. We were tempted to follow along since it was only 2:30 when we arrived to our campsite. But we stopped ourselves from doing that because that would mean arriving to camp around 7 pm and hiking 15 miles, both unreasonable for us at this time. We met a whole new crew here. All very nice people. Tonight is also when we had our first lightning storm and the heaviest rain. Our tent did well keeping us dry. Brandi is having some pain on the side of her right foot. Today we met someone that has been having the same pain, only much worse and for longer, and decided to end his hike. We'll have to keep a close look on that. -O\", 'Location: Fontana Dam\\nDescription: The Appalachian Trail goes right across Fontana Dam! Quite a few people that we have met on the trail in the last days were there too, so we crossed together. This also marks the beginning of the section that crosses the Great Smokies National Park.

We were among the first to leave camp this morning, so with the trail quiet we got to see deer and boar, and heard another turkey but couldn't spot it. When we got to camp there was a group of 6 kids with an outdoor program and a ridge-runner who checked our permits. I saw an orange salamander, which was high on my list of things to see. A snail also slimed onto my spoon and it was so cute I teared up. -O....just kidding -B\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Lunch\\nDescription: Derrick Knob Shelter.

I didn't realize how soft mine had gotten in just the couple hundred miles they've seen. -B\", \"Location: Double Spring Shelter\\nDescription: May 5. Night 27. Woot woot, new record! 13.5 miles today. The guy next to us did 20-something, but in a way I'm proud that we haven't pushed ourselves too hard. Our gradual increase has felt really good. I think I need to up my calories though, because I was still hungry after our incredibly delicious dinner of cheddar broccoli noodles with chicken and olive oil. Right now I'm doing about 3,200 a day, Olivier is doing 3,800+.

Unfortunately, we had no visibility today. Anyway, we have had many chances to view the mountains, so we didn't feel bummed to miss this one.\", \"Location: Mt Collins Shelter\\nDescription: May 6. Night 28. It's been rainy all day. We weathered a thunderstorm yesterday night, and the rain is continuing until tomorrow. But we have good rain gear, so we haven't been uncomfortable hiking in the rain so far. And since our time on the sailboat, we've gotten used to checking the weather and interpreting the forecasts. We knew that we had a window this morning where the rain would be lighter. We woke up early and hit the trail at 6:45, just as it was getting bright enough to see the trail without a headlamp. We summited Clingman's Dome, and then made it to this shelter around 11:00, before today's downpours. Many folks worse off than us rolled in over the next few hours, particulary a group of young weekend backpackers who were all soaking wet, almost hypothermic. The shelter is now full to the brim and we seem to be the only ones staying in our tent. It was a short, 5 mile day today. We're resupplying in Gatlinburg tomorrow, and this shelter is the closest we can get to our hitching point. -O\", \"Location: Hitchhiking point\\nDescription: Newfound Gap. After 5 miles we got here and ran into our friend GiGi, who we'd made an awesome meal with at Around the Bend hostel. After chatting it was an easy hitch into town.\", \"Location: Gatlinburg resupply\\nDescription: Gatlinburg. What.a.weird.place. It's like one giant amusement park. So many tourists. The outfitter here didn't have a great selection of shoes, and after trying a few and not feeling great about them, some guys offered to drive us to the REI 20 minutes down the road. They even browsed while we shopped and then drove us to Walmart for our resupply. This was awesome, but put us 45 minutes away from the trail in a place much harder to hitchhike. After what felt like an hour but was probably 20 minutes, a super nice couple (albeit a little wild!) that were just visiting the town picked us up and ended up driving us all the way back to the gap. 3 cars before them some guy in a truck couldn't give us a ride but handed us 20 bucks (for some reason a lot of people think AT hikers are poor...they haven't seen the price tags of our down sleeping bags!) so we gave it to the couple that drove us. So we made it back and it was chaos from start to finish. -B\", \"Location: Icewater Shelter\\nDescription: May 7. Night 29. It rained all day but here we are dry (mostly) and warm in our tent. We would've stayed in the shelter but there were already about 15 people hunkered down. It wasn't a very fun day, but the rain is leaving us sometime during the night and staying away for awhile. I think we'll be very ready for a hostel stay in Hot Springs when we get there in about 5 days. -B\", \"Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: One of the best views so far.

Night 30. Today was a beautiful day. The Smokies feel like true mountains rather than very large hills. No complaints...well, some complaints. I got new shoes and insoles yesterday... they felt great in the store but the 13 miles we did today told a different story. My heels were slipping and when I tied them tight enough to stop the slipping half of my toes went numb. It was rough. I'm feeling a bit lost on what to do, but the next town has a small outfitter that will hopefully have something that fits better. Additionally, I bought these ones from an REI so I should be able to return them even after dragging them through 50 miles of mud. I just hope I don't lose a toenail or mess up my feet in the meantime. On a happier note, we reserved TWO WHOLE NIGHTS at a hostel in Hot Springs, NC, the next town we go through. It will be our first true zero since Olivier was injured, and our first ever in town, as the last one was at a shelter. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Davenport Gap Shelter\\nDescription: May 9.

We walked a lot, we felt good. We really like waking up early enough that we can take a leisurely coffee break, a lunch break, and still get to camp before 5ish. That said, I still have to drag Olivier out of bed every morning (gently so he doesn't get too grumpy). I also started a new habit where I scare the crap out of him once a day by hiding behind a tree or something and then jumping out when he walks by. I've always been the faster walker of us, so it's pretty easy to pull off when he's lost in his own world long behind me. Yesterday it made him grumpy, today it made him laugh a lot. -B\", \"Location: VOR Tower\\nDescription: Some signal tower for air traffic. We've never seen anything like it. We ran into some friends we hadn't seen in a few days here. It was fun to hike with some other folks.\", \"Location: Ground Hog Creek Shelter\\nDescription: May 10. Night 32.

Then I dropped the phone and the screen shattered in the corner and sent cracks all the way across. Olivier doesn't put cases on his phones because he's just a real careful guy, but I'm not always so graceful. It bummed me out a lot.

We found a nice campsite right on the edge of town next to the river. For the first time on the trail, we had a total disaster of a meal. I had taken a potato soup mix from a hiker box at the last town, seemed pretty alright. When we were heating up the water I noticed that it expired in 2020. We gave it a good try, but it tasted pretty gnarly and the dehydrated sausage did not rehydrate. Unfortunately I had already poured the rest of our olive oil into the water when heating it, fortunately I hadn't put in the two chicken packets we had to add to it. So dinner turned out to be Olivier's left over plain instant mashed potatoes and a chicken packet each with a buffalo sauce we also scored from a hiker box. We're going to bed slightly unsatisfied, but the first thing we're doing in the morning is taking a shuttle to the grocery store. Maybe we'll eat and entire rotisserie chicken in the parking lot to make up for it. One can dream. -B\", \"Location: Friend stay\\nDescription: May 20. Night 42.

It was so hot that Olivier didn't even put on a rain jacket, and I used my umbrella but was already soaking wet with sweat. We got to the shelter 4 miles in and wanted to go a bit further, but the temptation of cover from the rain was too much so we stayed for the night. We decided to sleep in the shelter instead of pitching the tent to try to keep as dry as possible and have a quick exit tomorrow so we can get a lot done before the afternoon rain. The forecast is very very wet this week, but we're feeling highly motivated to make a few bigger mileage days. The sun always feels best after the rain anyhow.\", \"Location: Beauty Spot\\nDescription: We've gotten into the habit of stopping for a coffee break sometime after leaving camp and before lunch.

There weren't any mice, which was nice, but there were people talking loudly a bit later than we liked, plus some snoring. Happy to be tucked into our tent for the night. Hopefully it doesn't rain too much tomorrow.\", \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: We usually have breakfast before leaving camp, but today we decided to leave without eating because of the rain. We decided to hike 4 miles to the nearest shelter to cook breakfast under a rooftop. After breakfast, we checked the weather radar to get an idea of how long the rain would last. We saw that a large storm was heading our way. But we couldn't settle for a 4 mile day, so we decided to hurry to the next shelter to complete a 13 mile day and hope that the rain wouldn't be unbearable.

The $13 breakfast got us coffee in real mugs, juice, and the most amazing spread of dishes including tomato pie, quiche, brisket potato hash, egg souffle, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and much more. The tomato pie was my favorite, a southern dish I've never had before. Breakfast was at 8, so we hit the trail just after 9. It was the first day down from the mountains. Roan mountain was our last time above 6,000 feet for a long while. This meant the trail wasn't as steep, the forest looks very different, and there's a lot more water in various forms instead of just trickling springs. We hiked with some friends for awhile and all in all had a stellar time....UNTIL WE (I) DIDNT. We were feeling so fueled from our breakfast we thought we might do our longest day yet, even with heavier packs full of food, but at about 15 miles in we took a break and I suddenly felt very very nauseated. I waited a few minutes and it didn't pass, so I looked at the map and luckily there was a small campsite very close by. I basically sat against a tree in tears I felt so sick while Olivier pitched the tent and blew up my sleeping pad so I could lay down. I spent about an hour on the verge of puking, but started to feel better. I skipped dinner and napped, but my stomach is still going crazy. Norovirus breakouts happen a lot on the AT, so I'm nervous it could be that, but hopeful I'll wake up feeling fine. I know for certain that breakfast was too beautifully tasty to be the culprit of anything bad. -B\", 'Location: Lunch at Laurel Falls\\nDescription: May 26.', \"Location: Camping\\nDescription: May 26.

We made it about half a mile before I realized we only had less than 1/3 of a liter between us. Not wanting to turn back, we climbed the 2.6 miles up a mountain, taking just sips, to the next water source. By the time we got to the spring we were thirsty, but still alright. I guess the theme of the day was water, because we then found that the spring we were depending upon at our campsite was dry. It had started raining and we knew it was going to rain more and harder into the night, so being smart sailors we collected water using my rain skirt and scooped it into the water bag.

There was a lot of drunkenness, some fighting, loud music, and many dirty couches. But the lawn was large so we found a little corner to be comfortable in. In the morning we hiked to McAfee Knob, the most photographed spot on the AT. A lot of people try to get there for sunrise, but we were just happy to have clear weather for the view. Then we saw a deer with a baby fawn. The smallest I've ever seen, barely bigger than a house cat. Then we saw TWO bears. One of them had a hurt paw, poor thing.

They usually have to be attached for 24-36 hours before transferring enough of the bacteria that can give you Lyme disease, so we're just carefully checking during these tick infested times. Today while walking neither of us noticed a doe, nor her tiny fawn, and we accidentally walked right between them on the trail. When we heard the doe, we turned around and saw that the fawn had gotten confused and was actually following us. Every part of me wanted to snuggle and love that lil babe, not to mention get an epic photo, but getting between mom and baby is a dangerous game. Mama got very serious very quickly and we retreated quietly until we were no longer being perceived as a threat and baby wasn't following us.

When we got to the shelter we decided it was time to back flush our water filter since the flow had gotten very slow. We'd pushed water through it backwards before, but we learned a tip from someone of how to really get the crud out.

When we checked the weather we saw an extreme weather warning for a suddenly formed thunderstorm. We were 4 miles from the next shelter and weren't sure we would make it, but ended up getting there 5 minutes before a massive downpour. The people that showed up after us were totally soaked and borderline traumatized from the severe wind causing trees to fall and broken branches to fly through the air. We were now only 2 miles from the place we would hitchhike into town. Olivier really didn't feel like going, I really wanted to make it into town for a proper zero tomorrow. After the storm passed I convinved him to keep going, our only worry being that we'd heard it was a difficult hitch into town. When we got there, a fellow hiker we'd met all the was back in Georgia was giving rides and about to head in.

Our experience of the storm wasn't so bad, but today we saw that it took down a ton of trees, most of which were alive. So far the trail has proven to be much more mild weather-wise than boat life, but that storm would've been quite dangerous to be out in. We got to the shelter after a 20 mile day and there were no flat tent sites, so I checked down the trail and we hobbled a bit further to a creekside spot. Olivier wasn't feeling very good, slightly feverish and worsening, so I took care of the camp chores while he rested. I managed to get the bear line stuck up in a tree, so he had to get up anyways to help me get it down. Hopefully he'll wake up feeling just fine in the morning, but after being at the crowded town shelter, it's certainly possible he caught something that was going around. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Seeley/Woodworth Shelter\\nDescription: June 20.

Today we walked 22 miles, so of course we can manage a few more waking moments to write something. We saw another bear today, this mama was a bit threatening. Apparently, a southbound hiker had been trying to get her to leave the trail for 20 minutes when we showed up, unable to pass. She wasn't afraid of us and was making some rapid huffs and puffs that felt like a threat. But alas, we moved on and she didn't chase us down or rip our faces off.

A lady that was there asked what we were up to (we stick out like sore thumbs with our backpacks and general dirtiness) and we said we were trying to get showers. She invited us to her house to shower, said it was just around the corner. So we went with her and ended up staying the night. We went out for pizza for lunch, then the grocery store to resupply and get ingredients for dinner.

After we resupplied we grabbed a sub for lunch and hitched back to the trail. We've missed our last few nights of blurbs, but we've been really enjoying the trail. We had a quite rainy day yesterday. Even so our spirits were high and we made good mileage. We've been listening to podcasts and sleeping well. Olivier even ate leaves with a doe for a solid 5 minutes yesterday. They really bonded. She even stuck around camp the rest of the evening to keep an eye on her new crush. Our next town will be Harper's Ferry, which is on trail. This is really exciting because although it's not technically half way, the town is kind of known as the halfway point.

It was very crowded for the 4th of July weekend, so we decided to enjoy a quick visit and get back on the trail. First we went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters to get our photo taken for the yearbook they put together. We started out as numbers 2630ish and after making it about halfway we were 1372 and 1373. This doesn't mean we've passed a ton of people, it just means that more than half of the people who start a thru-hike don't make it this far. We're stoked we did! After that, we resupplied from the minimal selection at the outfitter just to get us two days down the road and headed out of town. Since we didn't get to do any chores while in town, we hand washed some socks and underwear when we got to camp, but before we headed to the water, some day hikers pulled chips and Gatorade out of their backpacks for the thru-hikers.

This morning was quite spectacular. It was about time for our coffee break and I considered having us stop in a clearing, but when I checked the map there was a shelter close to the trail less than half a mile away, and since a picnic table is always preferred to the ground or a log, we decided to go there. When we walked down the path to the shelter we spotted some containers and found that there were two big cinnamon rolls waiting for us. We were both very grateful for the extra calories, and enjoying them with our coffee was perfect. Thru-hiking is kind of funny like that...you find cinnamon rolls sitting on a table with no one in sight and no part of you questions that they are for you and definitely safe to eat. Other than that, it was a very uneventful day. The trail was quite rocky at times which slowed us down a bit. We started one audiobook that was very bad. Then later we started one that was very good.

It sounded like it would've made us sick, even if we tried to split the half gallon. We did go to the Appalachian Trail museum, which was quite neat. It's the first museum about hiking or the AT. The guy at the museum cast his doubts upon us about making it to Katahdin in time and suggested we consider flip flopping (probably general advice he was giving people coming through at the time but that I took personally).

I wanted to sit on a dry, comfortable couch with a warm blanket and a good movie. Not walk 16 miles. The feeling passed after some internal pep talk, and our day continued as normal. Before lunch we came to a very steep, rocky scramble. It was quite fun, but I was very glad the rocks had dried out in the little bit of afternoon sun.

Around lunch we were at an observation tower that a lot of New Yorkers come to to get out of the city, and the people watching was amazing. So many interesting groups of people, and a little trail magic in the form of cold drinks and chips. Then we descended all the way down to sea level, where the infamous trailside zoo is at. This morning I had seen comments that the zoo was closed during the weekdays currently, which broke my lil heart. We might have been able to wait if it had been Friday, but it's only Wednesday. I lived with the fact that we'd miss out, and celebrated that at least we'd be crossing the Hudson River. How cool!? When we got down, we walked through the park full of people barbequing and using little paddle boats on the water. We saw a sign saying the zoo *may* be closed on weekdays for new construction. To our great surprise, it was open. Which is awesome because the trail actually goes through the zoo...if you don't go through you have to take a side trail around, and we are NOT blue blazers.

We saw lots of reptiles, two sibling bears who'd been orphaned, one of which had alopecia so it was missing huge chunks of hair, owls that had been orphaned, an owl that had been shot, a turkey vulture that was hit by a car, an orphaned beaver, and many other cuties. It was such a sad/happy zoo of wonky animals. We finally left and crossed the Hudson on a half mile long suspension bridge that shook underneath us.

He has some English, but has had a hard time with logistics and making reservations or communicating where he needs to go with shuttle drivers. We gave him our number so he can reach out for help if he needs it. We left New York today! The states are flying by now. Virginia and Pennsylvania were very long, but the rest are all less than 500 miles I believe! Connecticut has been nice so far. Our biggest struggle right now is that this season has been soooo dry that a ton of the water sources are totally gone, even ones that are normally considered reliable year round. The down side is having to carry a lot more water than usual, the up side is that we haven't had to walk in hardly any rain.

In the middle of the day we had a few flat miles walking next to a big river, and then some more steep climbs. We did about 2 miles less than yesterday but got to camp at the same time. Last night we were the only ones at the campsite and it seems like tonight it's just us and a ridge runner.

The catch was that the facilities were quite dirty. Glen is a self admitted hoarder...I counted at least 6 broken lawn mowers around the yard. The bathroom was very gross with a moldy shower curtain and door that didn't shut properly, but the water was hot and our laundered clothes came out clean. We didn't mind at all.

When coming down from the second we hit our first trail magic of the day. Cold Gatorade, soda, and some fruit. The most magical part of this magic is that we were informed we had even more extensive trail magic 4 miles down the trail...perfect time for lunch. When we arrived we each ate two cheeseburgers and plenty of fruit. Amazing. The next two hours we were totally satisfied in appetite, but absolutely miserable in temperature. We were stopping every mile to cool down. Massachusetts has pretty strict rules on where you can camp, and we're trying our best to respect them, so we had to do 19.5 miles to make it to a campsite at a reasonable distance. I think I'll be more open to bending the rules during extreme heat next time. 4ish miles before camp we got our third trail magic! Some coolers with fruit, cold drinks, and some snacks.

Then a storm came through and got everything soaked. It was rough going for awhile. Very muddy and when not muddy the trail was slippery rocks. We didn't make very good speed all day. When we got to camp Olivier noticed some swelling in his Achilles tendon that we haven't noticed before. He isn't hurting any more than normal, but we'll have to keep an eye on it.

They didn't seem stoked on our presence, but not too bothered either. They stuck around for awhile before sauntering off the trail.

Manchester center is a cute town and we enjoyed our walk to the outfitter where we were able to exchange our old socks for new ones...a super sweet deal that darn tough does. They have a box specifically for the exchange and they were out of men's size medium socks, but luckily we know the women's large is the same thing!

Whenever we camp on a lawn without a strong breeze the condensation is out of control. Something about the grass, we aren't sure why. That had nothing to do with why I was so hot, I had cinched my bag closed like it was 30 degrees to warm up and fell asleep instead of the 50 it actually was. In the morning we grumbled about the cold and damp conditions, but got going as usual. It was one of the harder hitches we've done back to the trail. About 10 minutes in a guy took us 1 mile closer, which got us to a better spot for getting a ride the rest of the way. From there it took at least 20 minutes to get our ride to the trail head.

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. If you aren't familiar, the Yellow Deli is a chain of delis ran by the Twelve Tribes community. Many call them a cult, I guess most religions are a cult, but they are a community that live together and share everything. They run a hiker hostel that is donation based...I think they enjoy meeting the hikers and have successfully recruited a few who were looking for a place in the world. We thought we'd just eat, do our laundry, shower, and head back to the trail, but we found out that they do 'farm tours.' After the breakfast they serve everyone they take whoever wants to go out to see their farm and work for the day. Everyone was saying it was a really cool experience and we decided it was worth a stop. We've made good time and told ourselves that when we got closer to the end, if we saw something we wanted to check out, we would stop and enjoy it. So we're staying the night at the hostel, in our separate women's and men's bunk rooms, and tomorrow we'll go to the farm. A double zero! It's only the second time on trail we won't be hiking for 2 days straight. We heard there are kittens, so I think it'll be worth it. -B\", \"Location: Basin Farm\\nDescription: August 17. We went to the farm! It was awesome. Everyone was so nice. Of course it's different from my beliefs. They talk about religion often, the women are inside cooking and cleaning while the men are outside working, and their children are very very sheltered, but it seemed great. The people were happy and welcoming. We started the day with a short tour and then quickly got to pulling weeds and hoeing around some Swiss Chard. We pulled weeds for a couple of hours until lunch. They fed us watermelon and simple sandwiches that were completely homemade/grown with goat cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and relish. Back to weed pulling, then we went into the barn while it was raining to meet the kittens and other animals. After the rain passed we harvested potatoes! The farm feeds about 60 people and sells produce in town, so it was a lot of potatoes. It was lovely to be outside without packs on our backs, not thinking about hiking or the trail for almost a whole day. Farming is hard work. My only complaint of the day is that they really don't understand the appetites that hikers have developed. We need snack breaks! We even brought some snacks but didn't have time to eat them. The drive back is an hour and a half and by the time we arrived I was almost dead from starvation.

Our coffee was absolutely amazing because the Walmart in Rutland had the ever elusive whole powdered milk. Instant skim milk = gross. Instant whole milk = the best trail delicacy there is. We enjoyed our latte and stroopwafels like royalty. The afternoon was unremarkable. The forest was pretty, but my knees hurt from taking two days off the trail. It's a punishment I'm sure of it.

When we were packing our resupply a woman walked up and said she was offering trail magic in the form of a place to stay for the night, showers, and laundry.

Let us use her massage gun and foam rollers. I'm honestly amazed at the kindness someone can have towards total strangers. She hiked the trail in 2016 though, so in a way we aren't strangers.

Packing up a soggy campsite is one of the worst experiences. Everything is wet and dirty from mud splashing and bits of dead leaves sticking to every surface. Additionally, the descent we were about to do isn't one you would choose to do when wet. Only 1.5 miles, but over 1500ft per mile of drop. When we did leave camp, however, it was absolutely beautiful. You follow a cascade down the entire mountain that is sometimes gently flowing over rock, sometimes falling, and sometimes darting around in bright green moss funnels. The scenery was amazing, and although trickier when wet, nothing was too wild. We just had to take it really slow. It took us about 2 hours if not longer to do the mile and a half. When we got down, we hitched into town to resupply and pick up my new shoes from the post office. We hit the outfitter to once again replace our lost spoon. Hopefully third time is a charm. When we were in the outfitter getting our spoon a guy offered us a ride back to the trail in his convertible BMW. It was our slickest ride to trail yet.

It started raining right after we packed up camp, which is actually great timing because walking in the rain is pretty easy, but packing up in the rain sucks.

After traversing the three summits we were dropping back down into the trees right as we started hearing thunder in the distance. Once safely in the trees we ate lunch and put on our rain gear as the first drops were falling. The rest of the day was wet and slippery, but we were stoked about our luck in the morning!

We had thought about supplementing our provisions with food from the huts that are along the mountains, but it seems limited to stale baked goods and questionable soup, so we decided to hitch down the road to a gas station to restock our trusty packaged junk food. It was a risky move, hitching at 5:30 hoping to resupply, eat dinner, and hit the trail again to set up camp before dark, but we made it!

Camping isn't allowed in the alpine so we planned on going 12 miles to a hut where they have an emergency shelter called 'the dungeon' that they let thru hikers sleep in. It's just two triple bunks in a dark moldy room. We could pay to stay at the hut, but it's $200 each and they don't serve breakfast until 7, crazy people.

There was some rain forecast for the afternoon/evening and when 5 o'clock rolled around we had a hard time finding a spot. We ended up climbing all the way up a mountain until we found a spot to set up. Being on a peak during a storm isn't ideal, but there are at least trees for some protection.

We had a snack at the border and kept on to get to the notorious Mahoosuc Notch. Often referred to as the hardest mile on the AT. It's a .8 mile section of huge boulders. You have to climb up, down, under, through tight squeezes, down steep walls. It was crazy. It took us just over 2 hours to do 8/10ths of a mile. It was a lot of fun though, and occasionally a little scary. Southern Maine is no joke! -B\", 'Location: Trail Magic & Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Hall Mountain Lean-To\\nDescription: September 5. Night 150. We walked in the rain allllll day, so it's probably a good time to make a list of the things I'm not at all tired of. 1. Sleeping outside with the sounds of the forest around us. 2. Getting into such a warm sleeping bag at 7pm every day. 3. Getting 9-10 hours of hard earned sleep every night. (I think my favorite part of the AT is sleeping) 4. Only having two dishes to wash and they never need scrubbed, and a stove that never needs cleaned. 5. Getting trail magic. 6. The sunny days after the rainy ones. -B\", 'Location: Andover Resupply\\nDescription: Resupplied for 2 days.', 'Location: Trail Magic & Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Camp\\nDescription: September 6. Night 151. We went into town today just to get a couple of days worth of food. The town was Andover, Maine. So small that the only restaurant and the grocery store were the same room. The people were really nice, and we got a ride back to the trail just by standing outside the store chatting while we packed up. The guy who gave us a ride had a loaded pistol sitting in the cupholder of his truck, and was excited to share that Tucker Carlson was the neighbor of the town when we complimented Andover.

We had our longest day since before entering the white mountains. Over 15 miles! Maine is still gosh darn rocky and rooty and boggy, even if it isn't always so steep, so it took us all day. Nothing noteworthy from the day, but the camp we are staying at only has a pond as the water source. The edges are muddy and smell bad, but luckily there are a few canoes that you can take out into the middle of the pond to get cleaner water. Still tastes a little funky, but not the worst water we've ever drank. -B\", 'Location: Rangeley Resupply\\nDescription: Resupplied for 2.5 days starting September 9.', 'Location: Hitchhiking point\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Camp\\nDescription: September 8. Night 153. We hit 90% today! Any milestone we can think of we make sure to acknowledge, and we've been waiting for 90%. We went to town today to resupply and had a few vegetables while we were at it. We are having some foot problems that we can't seem to figure out. It's usually triggered by something in our shoe, like the ripped top layer of a soul or a wrinkle in a sock. Something small digs into our skin makeing a few little red hot spots. The weird thing then is that even after removing the initial trigger, the hot spots spread until it's one big red patch with very sharply defined edges. Sometimes it gets really tender to walk on. Other weird things happen with it, like it will heal and kind of callous over, but then part will regress back to the red shiny ouch stuff. It almost seems like a fungus in the way it spreads, and since we've both been dealing with it mostly only in the last few weeks. Anywho, that's the most interesting thing we've been dealing with. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Spaulding Mountain Lean-To\\nDescription: September 9. Night 154. Today was a butt kicker! It was steep and rocky and exposed! The afternoon was more mellow, and we were able to squeeze 15 miles out of the day by pushing super hard during the last 5 miles. We got to camp a little later than normal, but are still comfortably in bed by 7:30. The excitement tomorrow is that there's a church doing a big hiker feed at a road crossing tomorrow...the kicker is that we're 13.5 miles away and they'll only be there until 3pm. I believe there will be cheeseburgers, and I may be willing to risk life and limb hiking fast enough to get a cheeseburger. It's treacherous terrain tomorrow, but maybe we can do it.

UNTIL we got to a road crossing where someone from the church that was doing the feed told us that they'd probably be there until 4 or 5...they just start packing up at 3. The extra hours made the difference. We arrived at 4 just in time to catch a hot grill for a burger, and some veggies and baked beans. The real cherry on top is that they took us with them back to the church, stopping by the grocery store on the way to let us resupply. They did our laundry, let us shower, and we watched a great movie in the chapel before sleeping between the pews. Absolutely awesome. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Safford Notch Campsite\\nDescription: September 11. Night 156.

There are some mountains sprinkled in here and there, but the elevation change goes wayyyyy down.

Every once in awhile, maybe once every couple of months, I wake up in the morning with absolutely brutal stomach pain. Like acid reflux so painful you'd give a finger to stop it. Long story short, we didn't have our normal start to the day, but by 10am I was starting to feel better. The terrain was nice and easy, but we only ended up with 13 miles because of our late start, and we've decided we'll not be hiking late (late for us being much past 5) anymore. We want to enjoy the afternoons for the rest of our time here, and our flight isn't until October 1st, so we've plenty of time to spare. We got to camp before 5 and sat next to the lake enjoying the scenery and critters.

Night 158. We got ready quickly today to try to make it to the Kennebec river where there's a ferry that can take you across but only from 9am-2pm. It's too large to ford, but the ATC hires people to take hikers across during the busy season, probably to prevent penny-pinching people from trying to swim. The terrain was easy so we managed to do the 14 miles to the river by 1pm, we just skipped our normal coffee break. A guy with a canoe took us and our stuff across and another milestone was checked off. I think the only ones we have left are 100 to go, 2100 complete, and big ole Mama K (Katahdin) herself. We ended up with our longest day since before New Hampshire, finishing just shy of 20. We'll welcome the easier terrain, even if the views weren't nearly as epic. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Camp\\nDescription: September 14. Night 159. Quite an boring day. One nice climb with a view, but mostly just putting miles under our feet. We've been listening to Dune which has been quite entertaining, but can get heavy after a few hours so we've only been listening about 3 a day. We saw some very fresh moose tracks today, so we were on high alert for awhile but still no moose sighting. Still hopefully for seeing one in the hundred mile wilderness! Last night we had loons near camp again, but tonight we have a woodpecker. Not quite as nice sounding, but good entertainment to watch while eating dinner. -B\", 'Location: Mud pit & river fording\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Camp\\nDescription: September 15. Night 160. This morning was chilly and windy! Perfect day for fording rivers, right!? We had a few miles to warm up, then came to a muddy mess of a river crossing. It's been such a dry season that it really wasn't anything crazy, but the water came up to just above our knees. After the first one we walked in our Crocs for a half mile to the next crossing before we put our shoes back on. We had another crossing later in the day, and aside from that we had a normal day. We've been listening to Dune and are hitting quite an interesting point in the story, so we put in some good hours on that today. When we got to the highway in the afternoon, we decided to go ahead and get our resupply finished. We hitchhiked into town and got picked up by a couple who were very excited to help us. We did our biggest resupply yet at 6 days of food for 100 miles. It feels quite heavy, and theres some bad weather forecast, so I think we'll have some difficult days ahead.

It starts with fried potatoes, three eggs, and three strips of bacon followed by all you can eat blueberry pancakes. An incredible amount of food by people who know how hungry we truly are. The owner, Poet, brought a van full of us back to the trail around 9am. He left us with quite a touching few words to send us on our way, mostly that he knew how badly he wanted to be done when he got dropped off at this parking lot, but then you get your first open view of Katahdin and it's much too close, so soak it in. Well, we tried, and the first day of the 100 mile wilderness is in the books! It wasn't particularly hard trail, but carrying 6 days of food made it a little more difficult than normal. Tomorrow we're expecting some rain on and off until it culminates on Tuesday with cold temps and heavy rains all day, so we're hoping not to freeze our butts off. If the clouds happen to clear, we might get our first real view of the end tomorrow. The light at the end of the tunnel.

Night 164. Today was wild. The trail was just as steep, but well manicured with lots of rock stairs and nice maintenance. The rain stopped and the sun tried really hard to come out, but didn't. Still quite cold, but warm while moving. We went much faster than yesterday. The highlight was our first big view of Katahdin. There terrain between us and the end is quite flat, so the mountain is very prominent in the horizon. It was very cool to literally see the end in front of us. We did 17 miles and were eager to get to camp early to try to snag a spot in the shelter for more rain tonight. There was room when we arrived around 4 and while we were sitting around chatting a man walked up covered in sweat looking like he was going to pass out. At first we just let a man be exhausted when he gets up a big climb, but after a few minutes it was clear he was struggling and needed help. 30 minutes later I've undressed and redressed this man in dry clothes and gotten him in his sleeping bag to warm up. This guy was puking, shaking, and barely lucid. Unable to say words. It was pretty serious hypothermia symptoms. Eventually we got him feeling better, but it took all afternoon. Found out he hadn't eaten since breakfast, so he was pretty depleted after hiking all day. Aside from very sick dude, there were a few weird interactions with kind of rude people sprinkled in the evening. Ups and downs.

Since we were in the shelter we were able to easily stay dry and put on all of our rain gear before leaving. It rained all morning. It was very muddy and quite cold, but the trail was so easy after we did one little climb. We felt like racecars today. By 3pm the rain was stopping and we were able to dry up a bit. By the end of the day though, we had sore, wet feet and were tired. A fire had successfully been started at camp, so we were able to dry our socks and shoes. Finally back in our tent, dry and warm.

We were so comfortable last night. In our own tent, warm and dry. It was hard to get up this morning. I was feeling a bit tired, so when we came upon a beautiful lake with a view of Katahdin, we opted for an early coffee break. We had some data to download, so most of the afternoon we got caught up with the news and other podcasts we listen to. Quite an uneventful day, but a welcome change I suppose. No rain, no people in peril. We got to camp around 5pm after a 19 mile day, now only 33 miles from the end. If the end were just another regular mountain we'd be done in two days, but Katahdin requires permits, good weather, and some luck in getting a campsite for the night before summit. Hurricane Fiona is bringing high winds to the area this weekend, but Saturday will be the worst of it. Sunday is looking like our day, but if a bunch of other hikers are unable to summit on Saturday, we might have issues getting in the campsite.

We had to do our miles either way, and we knew it was going to rain all day, so we got up and got to it. And it did, it rained alllll day long. It's turned out to be the rainiest week we've had on the whole AT. Today wasn't as miserable as the past few rainy days had been because it was much warmer though. We tried to avoid the big puddles at first, but by noon we were stomping right through the mud and water, totally soaked. We got to camp early since we only had to do 15 miles and dried off. We were able to get an updated forecast during the one point in the day that we had a tiny tiny bit of service. Sunday is looking like our day! Only three more days, and tomorrow we're only hiking 3.5 miles. Woot woot. -B\", \"Location: Abol Pines\\nDescription: September 23. Night 168. We slept in this morning and stayed in our sleeping bags well after waking up. Around 10 we finally put our wet socks and shoes on and hit the trail. We got to Abol bridge and officially exited the 100 mile wilderness. When we walked out there was a guy with a nice camera who asked if he could take our photo for a piece he's doing for a magazine. He does portraits of thru hikers, so we're excited to see it! He caught us at our peak grossness after a week of being cold, wet, and without showers. After chatting with him for awhile we went to the camp store/restaurant for lunch. We resupplied from the very limited and expensive store, but embraced it as it's our last time doing it. Now we're headed to bed early because tomorrow we have to attempt to get two of only twelve spots available at the thru hiker shelter at the base of Katahdin. There are probably 25+ people looking to do the same, so it makes for a tricky situation. The ranger shows up at 7am, but people usually start queuing up before then. So is 6am early enough? Maybe, maybe not. 5am? If you don't get a spot, the ranger may be able to get you one at one of the campgrounds if there's been a cancellation, and otherwise you have to either wait another day or hike from where we are now all the way to the summit in one day. Ooftah. Normally it's not a huge deal, the shelter doesn't always even fill up, but Sunday is looking like the only good day to summit out of the few around it.

Guess what y'all. 5am was NOT early enough. Apparently the 12th spot for the birches was filled at 3:45am. I have to write it out to be able to capitalize it. THREE THIRTY-FIVE AM. First ones showed up at 3. We snagged spots 18 and 19 at 5am. Bonkers. When we got to the kiosk there were people in their sleeping bags, on their sleeping pads, basically camping. So it wasn't a great way to start the day, but we waited. There are some wheelchair accessible campsites that become available the morning of if no one's reserved them, and often they go to thru-hiker overflow. 40 people ended up there by 7. So when the ranger arrived the lucky 12 got their spots at the birches and we waited. Then he found one 6 person campsite that was available, meaning number 13-18 got to go. Dag nabit, we missed out again. I was getting a little bummed, but the ranger was super nice and fairly optimistic so we stayed hopeful! After those sites he said there were sometimes no-shows that the rangers at the campsites would be checking around for and maybe there'd be something. Then everyone left. It went from total chaos to just three of us sitting there waiting. The rules said you had to show up packed and ready to hike, so we were. We waiting and he checked back in every once in awhile. Around 9:30 we got a spot! At the Katahdin Stream campground! It felt like the luckiest day ever. We hiked 9 miles to the campground, super easy miles. Had lunch next to a waterfall. Went and got our permits to hike up the peak tomorrow. Ate dinner. Sat around and chatted with our fellow thru-hikers about what this whole crazy journey has been like. What we've loved, what we've despised, what's next. Tomorrow we'll do the last 5.3 miles of our thru-hike. It's looking like we might actually finish this thing. -B\", 'Location: Mount Katahdin\\nDescription: Northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.', 'Location: Appalachian Trail Lodge\\nDescription: September 25.

A band of connective tissue that stretches along the outside of the legs gets tense and inflamed due to overuse and tight muscles, causing it to rub against tendons and bones of the knee. At its worst, it feels like a stab to the side of the knee with every step. Luckily for us, it seems there's a few stretching exercises that can help prevent it.

We had a really short day today with beautiful weather. Since our pace is slow right now everyone we meet at the shelters are new to us. Today was a very comical group with lots of laughs. Towards the end of the night we were chatting with a section hiker who has the same knee problem as Olivier. He gave us some new exercises that we hadn't seen before that seem really hopeful. We go stay at a hostel tomorrow for the first time. Meaning yes, we've gone almost 2 weeks without a shower. Aside from our resupply tomorrow, our big goal is to find an exercise band for Olivier to strengthen his hips which should eliminate the problem with his IT bands. Still hopeful! -- The photo is of the water source at the shelter. Most shelters have one nearby and this one was particularly beautiful.\", \"Location: Dick's Creek Gap\\nDescription: Left the trail here and hiked 0.5 miles along the road to Around The Bend Hostel.\", \"Location: Hostel Around the Bend\\nDescription: Night 13. Staying at this hostel tonight. Showers, a bed, a ride to town and loaner clothes--exactly what the hikers need. We also got a chance to weigh ourselves for the first time since we got started. I've gained two pounds and Olivier has gained four. We've been trying our best to consume 3500-4000 calories per day and it seems it's been enough to put on weight. -- We went to Hiawassee again to resupply.\", 'Location: Plum Orchard Shelter\\nDescription: April 22, night 14. We took a shuttle from the hostel to the trail head and walked 5 miles to the closest shelter. My knees were great during most of the hike, but started to hurt right before the end.

At our afternoon break we met another advocate for kinesiology tape, so we threw a few strips on Olivier and apparently it worked pretty well. He felt great for the last 3.7 miles to camp. Until he was doing his strengthening exercises and did something weird to cause a big cramp/spasm in his leg and now his knee feels bad again. What a weirdo. This is why we can't have nice things. Anyways, we saw our second snake today, a bunny, and it took us 30 minutes to hang our bear line. Someone also left an apple on a sign at our campsite which was absolutely delicious. Very entertaining day. -B\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: ', 'Location: 100 miles mark\\nDescription: We reached the 100 mile mark of the AT at the summit of Albert Mountain after a steep climb. The view is great from up there, but clouds stated to surround us as we were arriving. It started to rain just as we were starting to hike down 10 minutes later. Rain gear out, it was a nice descent with a small gradient, and Brandi made up a song about being in the rain on the AT. -O', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped for lunch at Long Branch Shelter and there we met Dinosaur, a 74 year old thru-hiker. As we were chatting, he gave us some interesting news about the night before at Carter Gap Shelter. Out of 6 food bags that were hung, 4 were taken by bears! Brandi was right yesterday to skip Carter Gap Shelter and push on to Betty Creek. -O', \"Location: Rock Gap Shelter\\nDescription: April 26. Night 18.

Resupplied for 4.5 days, starting April 28. We had lunch in the parking lot. We got a pack of croissants and Brandi cooked breakfast sausages in front of amused passerbys. Franklin is very hiker-friendly, they are considered an 'Appalachian Trail Community.' While in Walmart one lady walked up, handed us $20, said 'Happy hiking,' and walked away before we could even respond. Another person brought a bag of candy bars to all of the hikers sitting out front! Many many others stopped to chat. It was lovely.\", \"Location: Siler Bald Shelter\\nDescription: April 27. Night 19. Would you believe, with packs full of heavy food, and the way Olivier's knees have been feeling, that we got to our planned campsite and decided to go an extra 3 miles??? Me neither. We're feeling really good. When it's cold or steep, Olivier is still having pain, but otherwise it's time to start moving on up! We ate Jimmy Dean breakfast burritos for dinner that we thawed in the sun at Walmart, then warmed up in our pockets at camp for that perfect 98 degree eating temperature. Add some fresh spinach and an avocado, it was divine. I also washed a gross Ziploc bag in the Walmart bathroom today so I think I'm officially hiker trash. -B\", 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: April 28. Hiked a side trail up Siler Bald after leaving camp this morning. There was a group of 4 recently retired guys that were a hoot to chat with.', \"Location: Tower\\nDescription: A very cool lookout tower where we could see a few of the mountains we came from. In particular, we could see the fire tower we were at a couple of days ago on top of Albert Mountain. It was a bit of a tourist stop too, so there were trash cans to offload our banana peels and other garbage we'd accumulated since town. The clear skies were a nice change from the rain we had at the last tower.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We ate so much food that we went another 5 miles after lunch. Salami, avocado, Asiago cheese, and pita bread. We even had salt and pepper packets from a Subway for the avo. Not everyone on the trail is surviving on peanut butter tortillas.', \"Location: Cold Spring Shelter\\nDescription: April 28. Night 20. We were worried about arriving late and not being able to find a flat spot to pitch the tent, but when we walked up at 5pm we were the first here out of what would turn out to be only 4 people. The shelter here is a very old original shelter, which was cool. Our bear line snapped (again, but a different line) while trying to hang our food, which was not cool. Fortunately, we've learned very quickly to never stand underneath the food you're hoisting or the branch you're using to hang it on. That 2+ pound bear can looks more appealing every day.\", \"Location: Fire Tower\\nDescription: Wesser Bald fire tower. The best view we've had so far.

Night 21. What a kick in the nuts of a morning. After feeling mostly great yesterday, Olivier's knees started hurting A LOT within the first 30 minutes of hiking. Around 11am we were feeling totally defeated and decided to just lay down in the shade for awhile. After a nap I felt motivated, so I did some more searching of the internet about ITBS, especially in long distance hikers, and found a new routine to try. Olivier was grumpy, but I basically insisted and by the end he was feeling much better. Enough so that we did 7 more miles! Did the routine of exercises and massages again at camp, and plan to keep it up twice a day. We're hopeful. Another day of highs and lows.\", \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: April 30. We skipped our usual breakfast at camp and instead hiked 1 mile to the town of Wesser and got breakfast at the diner there. The trail goes right through this small town. There's a general store, a restaurant and an outfitter--not much more.\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped for lunch at a viewpoint called The Jump Up. We had a variation of our typical lunch: pulled pork, cheese and a bagel. This time we also has a garlic spread that turned out to just taste like mayo. We also has two avocadoes, but we only ate one because the other one rolled down the mountain. Whoops.', 'Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: Cheoah Bald. The climb up this mountain was tough.', \"Location: Locust Cove Campsite\\nDescription: April 30. Night 22. We did another long day, especially considering we stopped for breakfast at the restaurant in NOC. 11.5 miles! Unlike yesterday, today was mostly pain free in the knee department. From yesterday morning at Cold Spring Shelter to now, we've ascended over 6500 feet and descended over 5000 feet. I think we've earned a nearo (near zero mile day) so we booked a hostel for tomorrow night that will pick us up just over 3 miles from here. Resting will be good, and a shower couldn't hurt either. -B -- We had an eventful night here. After sunset, when everybody was already in their tents and some people snoring, we could hear a large animal walk very close to camp. It came right alongside our tent and then ran away downhill. The noises persisted and we were convinced it was a bear trying to get a food bag that had been hung in that area. Brandi got out of the tent to investigate and realized that it wasn't a bear, it was two boars. There's no chance of them taking the food bag, but actually they are more dangerous than a black bear, so Brandi returned to the tent. Later in the night, I was woken up to other hikers yelling at a bear that was making noise up on a hill next to camp. Once again, we got out of the tent to investigate. With Brandi's super powerful headlamp, we could see that it wasn't a bear, it was a dear. -O\", 'Location: Trail Magic and Hitchhiking\\nDescription: May 1. Stecoah Gap. This was our planned spot to hitchhike into Robbinsville to resupply. When we arrived, we were very happy to see that there was trail magic. Two couples that were travelling in a camper had hotdogs, chips, drinks and other snacks. It was great. Then, the rain that was in the forecast materialized. It was a strong, but short-lasting downpour. After the rain had stopped, we went over to the road to hitchhike into town.

Before leaving the hostel we had a huge breakfast. 3 eggs each, half a package of bacon, and three big slices of toast. After getting dropped off at the trailhead at 9am we had a brutal climb, but the rest of the day was more mellow. We walked up on a wild turkey doing a big colorful display for a female before getting spooked by us and flying away through the trees along with his potential mate. We could hear their wings slapping the leaves and branches on the way out. We seem do be doing well with our new pace of 10-12 miles. The exercise routine is a pain to do twice a day, but it seems to be working!', \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: We skipped our usual breakfast at camp and instead just had a snack and left early to have breakfast at a bistro in Fontana. We were planning to hitchhike or catch a shuttle into town from here, but the road had no traffic and the shuttle entailed a 1 hour wait. So we decided to cook our usual breakfast grits instead of going into town. We had done our last resupply assuming we would get meal from town, so our change of plans meant we were short of 1 meal. So we walked to the Fontana Marina to get today's lunch. The options were limited to hiker food, so we got tortillas and tuna packets. It's what most people are eating regularly out here. -O\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: We stopped at a water source to eat the lunch items we got from Fontana Marina earlier today.', 'Location: Fire tower\\nDescription: This fire tower was very tall!

We had a satisfying 11+ mile day again. The people we were leapfrogging all day were going to a shelter that's 4 miles after this campsite. We were tempted to follow along since it was only 2:30 when we arrived to our campsite. But we stopped ourselves from doing that because that would mean arriving to camp around 7 pm and hiking 15 miles, both unreasonable for us at this time. We met a whole new crew here. All very nice people. Tonight is also when we had our first lightning storm and the heaviest rain. Our tent did well keeping us dry. Brandi is having some pain on the side of her right foot. Today we met someone that has been having the same pain, only much worse and for longer, and decided to end his hike. We'll have to keep a close look on that. -O\", 'Location: Fontana Dam\\nDescription: The Appalachian Trail goes right across Fontana Dam! Quite a few people that we have met on the trail in the last days were there too, so we crossed together. This also marks the beginning of the section that crosses the Great Smokies National Park.

We were among the first to leave camp this morning, so with the trail quiet we got to see deer and boar, and heard another turkey but couldn't spot it. When we got to camp there was a group of 6 kids with an outdoor program and a ridge-runner who checked our permits. I saw an orange salamander, which was high on my list of things to see.

I didn't realize how soft mine had gotten in just the couple hundred miles they've seen. -B\", \"Location: Double Spring Shelter\\nDescription: May 5. Night 27. Woot woot, new record! 13.5 miles today. The guy next to us did 20-something, but in a way I'm proud that we haven't pushed ourselves too hard. Our gradual increase has felt really good. I think I need to up my calories though, because I was still hungry after our incredibly delicious dinner of cheddar broccoli noodles with chicken and olive oil. Right now I'm doing about 3,200 a day, Olivier is doing 3,800+.

Yeehaw! -B\", \"Location: Clingman's Dome\\nDescription: May 6. We summited Clingman's Dome today. This is the highest elevation summit of the Appalachian Trail. Unfortunately, we had no visibility today. Anyway, we have had many chances to view the mountains, so we didn't feel bummed to miss this one.\", \"Location: Mt Collins Shelter\\nDescription: May 6. Night 28. It's been rainy all day. We weathered a thunderstorm yesterday night, and the rain is continuing until tomorrow. But we have good rain gear, so we haven't been uncomfortable hiking in the rain so far. And since our time on the sailboat, we've gotten used to checking the weather and interpreting the forecasts. We knew that we had a window this morning where the rain would be lighter. We woke up early and hit the trail at 6:45, just as it was getting bright enough to see the trail without a headlamp. We summited Clingman's Dome, and then made it to this shelter around 11:00, before today's downpours. Many folks worse off than us rolled in over the next few hours, particulary a group of young weekend backpackers who were all soaking wet, almost hypothermic. The shelter is now full to the brim and we seem to be the only ones staying in our tent. It was a short, 5 mile day today. We're resupplying in Gatlinburg tomorrow, and this shelter is the closest we can get to our hitching point. -O\", \"Location: Hitchhiking point\\nDescription: Newfound Gap. After 5 miles we got here and ran into our friend GiGi, who we'd made an awesome meal with at Around the Bend hostel.

The outfitter here didn't have a great selection of shoes, and after trying a few and not feeling great about them, some guys offered to drive us to the REI 20 minutes down the road. They even browsed while we shopped and then drove us to Walmart for our resupply. This was awesome, but put us 45 minutes away from the trail in a place much harder to hitchhike. After what felt like an hour but was probably 20 minutes, a super nice couple (albeit a little wild!) that were just visiting the town picked us up and ended up driving us all the way back to the gap. 3 cars before them some guy in a truck couldn't give us a ride but handed us 20 bucks (for some reason a lot of people think AT hikers are poor...they haven't seen the price tags of our down sleeping bags!) so we gave it to the couple that drove us. So we made it back and it was chaos from start to finish. -B\", \"Location: Icewater Shelter\\nDescription: May 7. Night 29. It rained all day but here we are dry (mostly) and warm in our tent. We would've stayed in the shelter but there were already about 15 people hunkered down. It wasn't a very fun day, but the rain is leaving us sometime during the night and staying away for awhile. I think we'll be very ready for a hostel stay in Hot Springs when we get there in about 5 days. -B\", \"Location: Viewpoint\\nDescription: One of the best views so far.

Night 30. Today was a beautiful day. The Smokies feel like true mountains rather than very large hills. No complaints...well, some complaints. I got new shoes and insoles yesterday... they felt great in the store but the 13 miles we did today told a different story. My heels were slipping and when I tied them tight enough to stop the slipping half of my toes went numb. It was rough. I'm feeling a bit lost on what to do, but the next town has a small outfitter that will hopefully have something that fits better. Additionally, I bought these ones from an REI so I should be able to return them even after dragging them through 50 miles of mud. I just hope I don't lose a toenail or mess up my feet in the meantime. On a happier note, we reserved TWO WHOLE NIGHTS at a hostel in Hot Springs, NC, the next town we go through. It will be our first true zero since Olivier was injured, and our first ever in town, as the last one was at a shelter. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Davenport Gap Shelter\\nDescription: May 9.

We walked a lot, we felt good. We really like waking up early enough that we can take a leisurely coffee break, a lunch break, and still get to camp before 5ish. That said, I still have to drag Olivier out of bed every morning (gently so he doesn't get too grumpy). I also started a new habit where I scare the crap out of him once a day by hiding behind a tree or something and then jumping out when he walks by. I've always been the faster walker of us, so it's pretty easy to pull off when he's lost in his own world long behind me. Yesterday it made him grumpy, today it made him laugh a lot. -B\", \"Location: VOR Tower\\nDescription: Some signal tower for air traffic. We've never seen anything like it. We ran into some friends we hadn't seen in a few days here. It was fun to hike with some other folks.\", \"Location: Ground Hog Creek Shelter\\nDescription: May 10. Night 32. The day started out rough. We kept running into this guy who I'm not a huge fan of, but he really enjoys us haha. Then I dropped the phone and the screen shattered in the corner and sent cracks all the way across. Olivier doesn't put cases on his phones because he's just a real careful guy, but I'm not always so graceful. It bummed me out a lot. We were back to laughing soon enough, or at least sweating a lot on all the uphill we had today. We got to camp at 12:30.

We also hit the 300 mile mark today. Probably most exciting of all, we foraged for the first time! We stumbled upon a mushroom called Chicken of the Woods and grabbed a big handful to take to camp.

We found a nice campsite right on the edge of town next to the river. For the first time on the trail, we had a total disaster of a meal. I had taken a potato soup mix from a hiker box at the last town, seemed pretty alright. When we were heating up the water I noticed that it expired in 2020. We gave it a good try, but it tasted pretty gnarly and the dehydrated sausage did not rehydrate. Unfortunately I had already poured the rest of our olive oil into the water when heating it, fortunately I hadn't put in the two chicken packets we had to add to it. So dinner turned out to be Olivier's left over plain instant mashed potatoes and a chicken packet each with a buffalo sauce we also scored from a hiker box. We're going to bed slightly unsatisfied, but the first thing we're doing in the morning is taking a shuttle to the grocery store. Maybe we'll eat and entire rotisserie chicken in the parking lot to make up for it. One can dream. -B\", \"Location: Friend stay\\nDescription: May 20. Night 42.

It was so hot that Olivier didn't even put on a rain jacket, and I used my umbrella but was already soaking wet with sweat. We got to the shelter 4 miles in and wanted to go a bit further, but the temptation of cover from the rain was too much so we stayed for the night. We decided to sleep in the shelter instead of pitching the tent to try to keep as dry as possible and have a quick exit tomorrow so we can get a lot done before the afternoon rain. The forecast is very very wet this week, but we're feeling highly motivated to make a few bigger mileage days. The sun always feels best after the rain anyhow.\", \"Location: Beauty Spot\\nDescription: We've gotten into the habit of stopping for a coffee break sometime after leaving camp and before lunch.

Staying in the shelter last night was a bit annoying and I'm not sure we'll be doing that again unless there's a huge downpour. There weren't any mice, which was nice, but there were people talking loudly a bit later than we liked, plus some snoring. Happy to be tucked into our tent for the night. Hopefully it doesn't rain too much tomorrow.\", \"Location: Breakfast\\nDescription: We usually have breakfast before leaving camp, but today we decided to leave without eating because of the rain. We decided to hike 4 miles to the nearest shelter to cook breakfast under a rooftop. After breakfast, we checked the weather radar to get an idea of how long the rain would last. We saw that a large storm was heading our way. But we couldn't settle for a 4 mile day, so we decided to hurry to the next shelter to complete a 13 mile day and hope that the rain wouldn't be unbearable. The next shelter happens to be the one at highest elevation of the AT, so yep, not the ideal one during a storm. -O\", \"Location: View\\nDescription: We got to see a bit of a view through the rain.

The rain was stronger earlier, but it hasn't stopped yet.

The $13 breakfast got us coffee in real mugs, juice, and the most amazing spread of dishes including tomato pie, quiche, brisket potato hash, egg souffle, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and much more. The tomato pie was my favorite, a southern dish I've never had before. Breakfast was at 8, so we hit the trail just after 9. It was the first day down from the mountains. Roan mountain was our last time above 6,000 feet for a long while. This meant the trail wasn't as steep, the forest looks very different, and there's a lot more water in various forms instead of just trickling springs. We hiked with some friends for awhile and all in all had a stellar time....UNTIL WE (I) DIDNT. We were feeling so fueled from our breakfast we thought we might do our longest day yet, even with heavier packs full of food, but at about 15 miles in we took a break and I suddenly felt very very nauseated. I waited a few minutes and it didn't pass, so I looked at the map and luckily there was a small campsite very close by. I basically sat against a tree in tears I felt so sick while Olivier pitched the tent and blew up my sleeping pad so I could lay down. I spent about an hour on the verge of puking, but started to feel better. I skipped dinner and napped, but my stomach is still going crazy. Norovirus breakouts happen a lot on the AT, so I'm nervous it could be that, but hopeful I'll wake up feeling fine.

We made it about half a mile before I realized we only had less than 1/3 of a liter between us. Not wanting to turn back, we climbed the 2.6 miles up a mountain, taking just sips, to the next water source. By the time we got to the spring we were thirsty, but still alright. I guess the theme of the day was water, because we then found that the spring we were depending upon at our campsite was dry. It had started raining and we knew it was going to rain more and harder into the night, so being smart sailors we collected water using my rain skirt and scooped it into the water bag.

There's a 'half gallon challenge' that people do at a general store near the halfway point...challenge being to eat an entire half gallon of ice cream. We did not participate. It sounded like it would've made us sick, even if we tried to split the half gallon. We did go to the Appalachian Trail museum, which was quite neat. It's the first museum about hiking or the AT. The guy at the museum cast his doubts upon us about making it to Katahdin in time and suggested we consider flip flopping (probably general advice he was giving people coming through at the time but that I took personally). I told him right where he could stick it, and that we're doing just fine.

Around lunchtime we walked through a small town, so we stopped to get a soda and chocolate milk to enjoy with our lunch, but didn't stay long since we are most eager to get to the next town where our new shoes are. There's a large section of the trail without shelters or many water sources, so we filled up our water at the last one and made our own tent site near the trail. Since it was unestablished there were a lot of branches to contend with, and Olivier stabbed his forehead with one.

We wanted to get the chore of resupply out of the way even after 18 miles, so we got a ride to the Walmart. After returning to town we went to the one restaurant available which was fairly mediocre, but satisfying nonetheless. We are now camped just outside of town on the AT where we're pretty sure we can camp but heard one rumor that cops come around and don't like hikers. There are no signs about camping not being allowed so maybe it's just a rumor, or maybe we'll wake up to a flashlight in our faces in a few hours.

After that, we had a restful night. This morning we saw a big ole bear. Number 10! It was very scared of us and ran away huffing and panicked. The day was quite rocky, including a couple of sections of scrambling where we had to put our poles away to use our hands. The big boulders are kind of fun...you can climb on them and hop across with secure footing, but the fields of toaster sized rocks are quite a headache. Or footache. Both. When we got to camp today we found out that on the trail to the water from camp, the first two springs were totally dry and the walk to water was almost a mile down a rocky, overgrown path. Or so I heard, Olivier was the hero today and went to get our water. Tomorrow we have another water source about a half a mile away and it will be my turn to make the journey.

After an hour or so of good rain, we start getting a little wet inside. It was still sprinkling when we woke up, but we carried on with our normal schedule. It made me grumpy though, especially when all the wet grass and plants got our feet totally soaked. A mile into our day, I didn't feel like walking anymore. I wanted to sit on a dry, comfortable couch with a warm blanket and a good movie. Not walk 16 miles. The feeling passed after some internal pep talk, and our day continued as normal. Before lunch we came to a very steep, rocky scramble. It was quite fun, but I was very glad the rocks had dried out in the little bit of afternoon sun. At the end of our day, we stopped for a short break to check the weather and I forgot my pee rag at the break spot. When we got to camp after 30 more minutes of walking I realized and decided it was worth going back, so I got to hike an extra 2.2 miles today to fix my silly mistake. Oh well.

There's a restaurant in town that let's you camp out back, so we pitched the tent and did some laundry by hand. We even showered by taking turns pouring water for each other back in the trees.

Shortly after, we hit mile marker 1300 where we met a man who's trail name is Magic Mike... Clearly not because of resemblance to the character. He was taking photos of the rock display with a small cross next to it of ashes. We chatted for a minute and he said they were the ashes of his son and wife. In the last two years he's lost both of them unexpectedly. During our conversation, he seemed so positive, even while teary eyed. Some thru-hikers annoy the crap out of me, but Magic Mike seemed like a great guy who's been through a lot of heartache. I hope we see more of him. The rest of the day was fairly normal. Towards the end we walked past a quite impressive beaver dam. I can't think of any animals that have the power to change the landscape around them so dramatically.

The trail magic was 11 miles from where we camped, so it lined up perfectly to stop for lunch. There was a huge sprawl of sandwiches, snacks, cold drinks, fresh fruit, and ice cream, with a charging station and camp chairs to top it off. We stuffed ourselves. In the afternoon we saw some storm clouds and wound up at a pavilion just before the rain started. There was a former thru-hiker there with a cooler and we broke our normal habit of not drinking on trail and took a beer to enjoy while waiting for the rain to pass.

Lots of more hikers came and most of the lawn was taken before too long. Our long-time friend Buff showed up too. When the movies started playing we were really confused because Thor seemed to be very slow paced and kind of eerie. Turns out Pop-Pop, the owner, told us all the wrong screen so we were watching the weird horror movie instead. We didn't feel like packing everything up and moving, so I just went to bed and Olivier watched most of the movie. We had been warned to not expect to get to sleep until 1:30am, but I slept through all of the commotion...even when the cars drove out and new in for the second movie.

When we got to camp the water was mostly dry, but we didn't want to leave the other hiker here alone to go further because some mentally ill man has been showing up threatening people and sometimes destroying property.

Around lunch we were at an observation tower that a lot of New Yorkers come to to get out of the city, and the people watching was amazing. So many interesting groups of people, and a little trail magic in the form of cold drinks and chips. Then we descended all the way down to sea level, where the infamous trailside zoo is at. This morning I had seen comments that the zoo was closed during the weekdays currently, which broke my lil heart. We might have been able to wait if it had been Friday, but it's only Wednesday. I lived with the fact that we'd miss out, and celebrated that at least we'd be crossing the Hudson River. How cool!? When we got down, we walked through the park full of people barbequing and using little paddle boats on the water. We saw a sign saying the zoo *may* be closed on weekdays for new construction. To our great surprise, it was open. Which is awesome because the trail actually goes through the zoo...if you don't go through you have to take a side trail around, and we are NOT blue blazers. The zoo is only native species who are unable to be released back into the wild. Most have either been injured or were orphaned as wee babes and raised in captivity. We saw lots of reptiles, two sibling bears who'd been orphaned, one of which had alopecia so it was missing huge chunks of hair, owls that had been orphaned, an owl that had been shot, a turkey vulture that was hit by a car, an orphaned beaver, and many other cuties. It was such a sad/happy zoo of wonky animals. We finally left and crossed the Hudson on a half mile long suspension bridge that shook underneath us.

Our biggest struggle right now is that this season has been soooo dry that a ton of the water sources are totally gone, even ones that are normally considered reliable year round.

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. If you aren't familiar, the Yellow Deli is a chain of delis ran by the Twelve Tribes community. Many call them a cult, I guess most religions are a cult, but they are a community that live together and share everything. They run a hiker hostel that is donation based...I think they enjoy meeting the hikers and have successfully recruited a few who were looking for a place in the world. We thought we'd just eat, do our laundry, shower, and head back to the trail, but we found out that they do 'farm tours.' After the breakfast they serve everyone they take whoever wants to go out to see their farm and work for the day. Everyone was saying it was a really cool experience and we decided it was worth a stop. We've made good time and told ourselves that when we got closer to the end, if we saw something we wanted to check out, we would stop and enjoy it. So we're staying the night at the hostel, in our separate women's and men's bunk rooms, and tomorrow we'll go to the farm. A double zero!

The people were happy and welcoming. We started the day with a short tour and then quickly got to pulling weeds and hoeing around some Swiss Chard. We pulled weeds for a couple of hours until lunch. They fed us watermelon and simple sandwiches that were completely homemade/grown with goat cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and relish. Back to weed pulling, then we went into the barn while it was raining to meet the kittens and other animals. After the rain passed we harvested potatoes! The farm feeds about 60 people and sells produce in town, so it was a lot of potatoes. It was lovely to be outside without packs on our backs, not thinking about hiking or the trail for almost a whole day. Farming is hard work. My only complaint of the day is that they really don't understand the appetites that hikers have developed. We need snack breaks! We even brought some snacks but didn't have time to eat them.

Our coffee was absolutely amazing because the Walmart in Rutland had the ever elusive whole powdered milk. Instant skim milk = gross. Instant whole milk = the best trail delicacy there is. We enjoyed our latte and stroopwafels like royalty. The afternoon was unremarkable. The forest was pretty, but my knees hurt from taking two days off the trail. It's a punishment I'm sure of it. We decided to keep it relatively short and stopped after 16 miles. We finished dinner and got into bed by 6:30. Awesome. After two nights sleeping in separate men's and women's dormitories, we're excited to watch some Netflix and snuggle. -B\", 'Location: On the Edge Farm\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', 'Location: Vermont / New Hampshire border\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Trail magic stay\\nDescription: August 20.

We went to resupply after walking through Hanover, home of Dartmouth College. It was a cute town. When we were packing our resupply a woman walked up and said she was offering trail magic in the form of a place to stay for the night, showers, and laundry. We asked how many she could host, she said 4, there were 4 of us, so we went! We had already done 15 miles, so it was a relatively good days work anyways. She took us to her house and fed us. Let us use her massage gun and foam rollers. I'm honestly amazed at the kindness someone can have towards total strangers. She hiked the trail in 2016 though, so in a way we aren't strangers.

Today was a short day, but it didn't really feel like it. We slept in partially because we were going to town today and partially because it was still raining pretty hard in the morning. Packing up a soggy campsite is one of the worst experiences. Everything is wet and dirty from mud splashing and bits of dead leaves sticking to every surface. Additionally, the descent we were about to do isn't one you would choose to do when wet. Only 1.5 miles, but over 1500ft per mile of drop. When we did leave camp, however, it was absolutely beautiful. You follow a cascade down the entire mountain that is sometimes gently flowing over rock, sometimes falling, and sometimes darting around in bright green moss funnels. The scenery was amazing, and although trickier when wet, nothing was too wild. We just had to take it really slow. It took us about 2 hours if not longer to do the mile and a half. When we got down, we hitched into town to resupply and pick up my new shoes from the post office. We hit the outfitter to once again replace our lost spoon. Hopefully third time is a charm. When we were in the outfitter getting our spoon a guy offered us a ride back to the trail in his convertible BMW. It was our slickest ride to trail yet. Back on trail we hiked 4 rugged miles to a kind of lumpy campsite and tried to dry everything off. Thankfully it's not forecast to rain tonight.

The moss was vibrant and covering everything. It was nice and cool. And at the top, the views were some of the best that we've had. It felt like being in real mountains for the first time since the Smokies. Normally, by 1pm we've done 10-12 miles depending on the terrain. Today, we did 12.4 by the time we got to camp at 5:30pm, and that was our normal 7am start with normal breaks. It's no joke that the white mountains slow you down! The day was so fun. A lot of hikers get frustrated by how slow they have to go, especially since they're ready to be finished, but we're just trying to ignore the mileage and enjoy the change of scenery. Tomorrow looks like bad weather and we have a big ridge to traverse. If it's only sprinkling, we'll probably go for it and just miss out on the views for the day, but if there's lightning systems we might have to wait it out until the next day.

Night 140. We had another awesome day. There were some thunderstorms predicted, but there was a safe campsite 2.5 miles from where we stayed last night, so we could decide when we got there whether or not to go up onto the exposed ridge line. It started raining right after we packed up camp, which is actually great timing because walking in the rain is pretty easy, but packing up in the rain sucks. It rained for about an hour and then started to clear up. When we got to the campsite we saw on the radar that there was a pretty serious thunderstorm but it was still at least two or three hours away, so we decided to go for it. We ended up with some really great views between the clouds that were rolling by, which was more than we had hoped for. After traversing the three summits we were dropping back down into the trees right as we started hearing thunder in the distance. Once safely in the trees we ate lunch and put on our rain gear as the first drops were falling. The rest of the day was wet and slippery, but we were stoked about our luck in the morning! We found a small spring and a flat spot to call it a night.

Night 141. It rained during the night but was mostly done in the morning. We just had wet stuff and tree rain to deal with. The morning was steep and rocky, as is normal now. At lunch we had one of the best views we've had so far, one that makes us see why the trails are so steep and rocky, ha. After lunch, however, we had 6ish miles of almost flat terrain as we walked along a valley with smooth trail and views from the bottom instead of the top. We had thought about supplementing our provisions with food from the huts that are along the mountains, but it seems limited to stale baked goods and questionable soup, so we decided to hitch down the road to a gas station to restock our trusty packaged junk food. It was a risky move, hitching at 5:30 hoping to resupply, eat dinner, and hit the trail again to set up camp before dark, but we made it! A day hiker took us there and a local getting off work took us back. We set up at dusk and by the time we finished our chores to lay down, it was totally dark. Tomorrow we're back to the mountains, but tonight we sleep by the highway. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Lakes of the Clouds\\nDescription: August 28. Night 142. We started the day with a big climb into the Presidential range. When we got above tree line we decided to take two side trails to hit Mt Einsenhower and Mt Monroe. The weather was perfect so the extra effort seemed worth it for the views. Camping isn't allowed in the alpine so we planned on going 12 miles to a hut where they have an emergency shelter called 'the dungeon' that they let thru hikers sleep in. It's just two triple bunks in a dark moldy room. We could pay to stay at the hut, but it's $200 each and they don't serve breakfast until 7, crazy people.

Today was crazy! It was foggy when we woke up, but we don't have time to wait around for perfect weather with views, so we take good enough. The hike up to Mt Washington was relatively mellow terrain, but it was windy and chilly. The fog was so thick that the moisture was condensing on the side of us that was into the wind. On our clothes, eyelashes, and hair. Up top we couldn't see the buildings until we were 30 feet away. We found a protected area to have our coffee. For a few miles after the peak we were in the same very windy, wet conditions. The terrain in the afternoon was particularly brutal. After lunch we only had 3.6 miles to go, but didn't get to camp until 6. The trail was just descending a huge pile of rocks. I think it ended up being the hardest 10 miles of the trail so far. We've had a harder 22 mile day, but never such a difficult 10 mile day. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Camp\\nDescription: August 30. Night 144. We had some easier miles to start the day. We got to the Pinkham notch visitors center around our coffee break time. They have a small outfitter where we were hoping to find some new insoles for Olivier, but it was more of a tourist outfitter than a real one. The afternoon was steep, but easier than yesterday. There was some rain forecast for the afternoon/evening and when 5 o'clock rolled around we had a hard time finding a spot. We ended up climbing all the way up a mountain until we found a spot to set up. Being on a peak during a storm isn't ideal, but there are at least trees for some protection. Maybe we'll wake up in a puddle of water, maybe we'll get struck by lightning and cooked to a crisp, maybe the storm will pass north of us.

We got two frozen pizzas and a pint of Ben & Jerry's from the store for dinner. We did our chores and walked around the local farmers market.

Something small digs into our skin makeing a few little red hot spots. The weird thing then is that even after removing the initial trigger, the hot spots spread until it's one big red patch with very sharply defined edges. Sometimes it gets really tender to walk on. Other weird things happen with it, like it will heal and kind of callous over, but then part will regress back to the red shiny ouch stuff.

Maybe, maybe not. 5am?

We're planning on queuing up at 5am, but don't tell the others. -B\", 'Location: Lunch\\nDescription: ', \"Location: Katahdin Spring Campgrounds\\nDescription: September 24. Night 169. Guess what y'all. 5am was NOT early enough. Apparently the 12th spot for the birches was filled at 3:45am. I have to write it out to be able to capitalize it. THREE THIRTY-FIVE AM. First ones showed up at 3. We snagged spots 18 and 19 at 5am. Bonkers. When we got to the kiosk there were people in their sleeping bags, on their sleeping pads, basically camping. So it wasn't a great way to start the day, but we waited. There are some wheelchair accessible campsites that become available the morning of if no one's reserved them, and often they go to thru-hiker overflow. 40 people ended up there by 7. So when the ranger arrived the lucky 12 got their spots at the birches and we waited. Then he found one 6 person campsite that was available, meaning number 13-18 got to go. Dag nabit, we missed out again. I was getting a little bummed, but the ranger was super nice and fairly optimistic so we stayed hopeful! After those sites he said there were sometimes no-shows that the rangers at the campsites would be checking around for and maybe there'd be something. Then everyone left. It went from total chaos to just three of us sitting there waiting. The rules said you had to show up packed and ready to hike, so we were. We waiting and he checked back in every once in awhile. Around 9:30 we got a spot! At the Katahdin Stream campground! It felt like the luckiest day ever. We hiked 9 miles to the campground, super easy miles. Had lunch next to a waterfall. Went and got our permits to hike up the peak tomorrow. Ate dinner. Sat around and chatted with our fellow thru-hikers about what this whole crazy journey has been like. What we've loved, what we've despised, what's next. Tomorrow we'll do the last 5.3 miles of our thru-hike. It's looking like we might actually finish this thing. -B\", 'Location: Mount Katahdin\\nDescription: Northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.', 'Location: Appalachian Trail Lodge\\nDescription: September 25.

        "The benefit of using asynchronous code to create our embeddings is that we can make many concurrent calls to the embedding model at once, which explains why the above cell ran so quickly. Simply using `asyncio` isn't magic, though. We can follow the chain of method calls from `abuild_from_list` to `async_get_embeddings` where we finally see that we're calling our embedding model in batches, processing multiple batches at once using `asyncio.gather` (similar to `Promise.all()`). Neat!\n",

        "\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
        "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
        "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

If we give several consistent examples of what we want the LLM to do, it's going to be very likely to consistently follow those examples, given it's provided with a prompt that's appropriate to those examples.\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific task you're trying to accomplish and the type of data you're working with. Here are a few general guidelines to help you write effective loops:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Choose the Right Loop Structure**:\n",
            "   - Use a `for` loop when iterating over a collection (like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string).\n",
            "   - Use a `while` loop when you need to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Keep It Simple**:\n",
            "   - Write clear and concise loop conditions to avoid confusion.\n",
            "   - Limit the complexity of operations inside the loop to enhance readability.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Use `enumerate()` for Indexing**:\n",
            "   - If you need both the index and the value from an iterable, use `enumerate()`. It provides the index and value as you iterate.\n",
            "     ```python\n",
            "     my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
            "     for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
            "         print(index, value)\n",
            "     ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **List Comprehensions for Simple Loops**:\n",
            "   - For simple loops that generate a new list, consider using a list comprehension, which is more concise and generally faster.\n",
            "     ```python\n",
            "     squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "     ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Use `break` and `continue` Wisely**:\n",
            "   - Use `break` to exit a loop early if a condition is satisfied. Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Avoid Modifying the Collection During Iteration**:\n",
            "   - Modifying the collection you are looping over can lead to unexpected behavior. If you need to modify it, consider creating a new collection or using list comprehensions.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Ensure Proper Indentation**:\n",
            "   - Python relies on indentation to define the blocks of code. Maintain consistent indentation to avoid errors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s a simple example of a `for` loop:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "for i in range(5):\n",
            "    print(f\"Hello, world! {i}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "And a `while` loop example:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(f\"Hello, world! {count}\")\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",

            "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to a situation where a CEO, who has a strong background in a particular area (such as product management, sales, or marketing), hires a weak executive for that same function. This phenomenon often occurs because the CEO struggles to let go of the expertise that initially contributed to their success and, as a result, selects a less competent executive in that role to maintain a sense of control and remain “the man” in that area. This issue is exemplified by Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite being a skilled television network executive, faced challenges when ABC fell to fourth place after its acquisition. His response, indicating that he could turn around the network if he had more time, highlights the unrealistic expectations that can stem from this problem.\n",
